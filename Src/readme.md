# Polkadot E-commerce SDK

Polkadot E-commerce SDK is a comprehensive toolkit that simplifies the integration of blockchain technology into e-commerce platforms. It is built on top of the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem.

## Features

- Key Management: Generate and manage key pairs required for transaction signing.
- Order Management: Create, update, and view orders on the blockchain.
- Inventory Management: Keep track of product stock levels on the blockchain.
- Shopping Cart Management: Add items to a shopping cart and handle the checkout process.
- Payment Processing: Handle blockchain payments for orders.
- Basic Analytics: Track events related to orders, inventory, and payments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12.x or above)
- npm (version 6.x or above)

## Installation

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/polkadot-ecommerce-sdk.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd polkadot-ecommerce-sdk
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Setup

Before using this SDK, you need to deploy the corresponding smart contracts to the Polkadot network and get their addresses. The SDK also requires the URL of the Polkadot node it will connect to and, if you want to use the analytics features, the URL of your analytics server.

## Usage

```javascript
const PolkadotSDK = require('polkadot-ecommerce-sdk');

// Initialize the SDK
const nodeUrl = 'wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws';
const contractAddress = 'your-contract-address';
const analyticsUrl = 'your-analytics-url';
const sdk = new PolkadotSDK(nodeUrl, contractAddress, analyticsUrl);

// Use the SDK
const keyPair = sdk.keyManagement.createPair('//Alice');
const orderData = { /* ... */ };
const orderHash = await sdk.orderManagement.createOrder(orderData, keyPair);
```

See the example files in the `examples` folder for more detailed usage instructions.

## Contribute

If you have suggestions for how Polkadot E-commerce SDK could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! Contributions are always welcome!

Please replace `'your-github-username'`, `'your-contract-address'`, and `'your-analytics-url'` with the correct URLs. Also, please update the Node.js and npm version prerequisites as necessary. The features list can be expanded or adjusted based on the actual capabilities of your SDK.

Remember, this is just a template. Depending on your SDK's complexity and intended audience, you might need to add additional sections such as a FAQ, a detailed API reference, or a guide for contributors.
